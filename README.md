### All tasks and duties in federal service should have their genesis in the laws and statutes created by the United States Congress and enacted into law by Presidential signings.  This unofficial document will assist members of NOAA/NWS/OWP at the National Water Center by providing examples of statutes and laws describing the duties and responsibilities of the organization which we are employed. 

## 15 U.S. Code ยง 313
Probably the top level document which charges the Secretary of Commerce with "the display of weather and flood signals for the benefit of agriculture, commerce, and navigation", "the distribution of meteorological information in the interests of agriculture and commerce, and the taking of such meteorological observation as may be necessary to estalish and record the climatic conditions of the United States, or as are essential for the proper execution of the foregoeing duties".

## 42 U.S. Code ยง 10371
This document establishes the role and responsibilities of the National Water Center.  The Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall establish "a center (i) to serve as the research and operational center of excellence for hydrologic analyses, forecasting, and related decision support services within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service; and (ii) to facilitate collaboration across Federal and State departments and agencies, academia, and the private sector on matters relating to water resources.

#### Functions
- (A) Improving understanding of water resources, stakeholder needs regarding water resources, and identifying science and services gaps relating to water resources.\
- (B) Developing and implementing advanced water resources modeling capabilities.\
- (C) Facilitating the transition of hydrologic research into operations.\
- (D) Delivering analyses, forecasts, and inundation information and guidance for all hydrologic events in the United States, including flash flooding, riverine flooding, and water resources outlooks.\
- (E) In coordination with warning coordination meteorologists, providing decision-support services to inform emergency management and water resources decisions.\

#### Total Water Prediction
 - (1) initiate and lead research and development activities to develop operational water resource prediction and related decision support products;

 - (2) collaborate with, and provide decision support regarding total water prediction to-

    - (A) the relevant Federal agencies represented on the National Science and Technology Council, Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and Sustainability and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction;

    - (B) State water resource agencies; and

    - (C) State and local emergency management agencies; and

- (3) in carrying out the responsibilities described in paragraphs (1) and (2), collaboratively develop capabilities necessary for total water predictive capacity, including observations, modeling, data management, supercomputing, social science, and communications.

## S.558 - FLOODS Act (Public Law 117-316)

This law establishes a national integrated flood information system with NOAA and other purposes.  
### Sec. 3. National Integrated Flood Information System
### Sec. 4. Observations and modeling for total water prediction.
### Sec. 6. Improving National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration communication of future flood risks and hazardous flash flood events.
### Sec 12. Estimates of precipitation frequency in the United States.
### Sec 16. Gap analysis on availability of snow-related data to assess and predict flood and flood impacts.
### Sec 17. Availability to the public of flood-related data.
